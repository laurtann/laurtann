### Why, Hello There!

I'm Laura, a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer based in Halifax, NS. 

!["Isn't she cute"](https://github.com/laurtann/laurtann/blob/main/github-clem.png?raw=true)

I am a recent grad of Lighthouse Labs' Web Development Bootcamp where I learned about all things JavaScript & Ruby and am currently looking for new opportunities! 

When I'm not coding or filming TV shows in tattoo shops (long story), I can usually be found somewhere in nature with my boxer, Clementine.

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-tannahill/), and while you're here check out some of the neat things I'm working on at www.lauratannahill.com
