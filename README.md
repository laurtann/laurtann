### Why, Hello There!

I'm Laura, a Full-Stack Web Developer based in Halifax, NS.

I'm currently student in Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp learning about all things Javascript & Ruby. 

When I'm not coding, travelling or filming TV shows in Tattoo Shops (long story), I can usually be found somewhere in nature with my boxer, Clementine.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-tannahill/) and while you're here check out some of the neat things I'm working on at www.lauratannahill.com
