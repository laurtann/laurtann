### Why, Hello There!

I'm Laura, a Full-Stack Developer based in Halifax, NS.

I found a passion for programming and all things business automation while completing a diploma in marketing management at Fanshawe College in 2019. I went on to complete Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp and am now working as a NetSuite developer at [Starling Solutions and Blend ERP](https://www.blend-erp.com/) helping manufacturers streamline their business processes.

When I'm not coding or filming TV shows in tattoo shops (long story), I can usually be found somewhere in nature with my boxer, Clementine.
