### Why, Hello There!

I'm Laura, a Full Stack Developer based in Halifax, NS.

I found a passion for programming while completing a diploma in Marketing Management at Fanshawe College in 2019 and haven't stopped since!

When I'm not coding or filming TV shows in tattoo shops (long story), I can usually be found somewhere in nature with my boxer, Clementine.
